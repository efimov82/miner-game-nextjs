              <h1>Welcome to the Minesweeper game!</h1>
              <p>
                In Minesweeper mines are scattered throughout a board, which is
                divided into cells. Cells have three states: uncovered, covered
                and flagged. A covered cell is blank and clickable, while an
                uncovered cell is exposed. Flagged cells are those marked by the
                player to indicate a potential mine location.
              </p>

              <h2>Gameplay</h2>
              <p>
                A player left-clicks a cell to uncover it. If a player uncovers
                a mined cell, the game ends, as there is only 1 life per game.
                Otherwise, the uncovered cell displays either a number,
                indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it,
                or a blank tile, and all adjacent non-mined cells will
                automatically be uncovered. Right-clicking (long-pressing on
                Mobile) on a cell will flag it, causing a flag to appear on it.
                Flagged cells are still considered covered, and a player can
                click on them to uncover them, although typically they must
                first be unflagged with an additional right-click. To win the
                game, player must flagging all the mined cells.
