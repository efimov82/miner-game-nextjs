  "description": "In Minesweeper mines are scattered throughout a board, which is divided into cells. Cells have three states: uncovered, covered and flagged. A covered cell is blank and clickable, while an uncovered cell is exposed. Flagged cells are those marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location.",
  "gameplay": "Gameplay",
  "rules": "A player left-clicks a cell to uncover it. If a player uncovers a mined cell, the game ends, as there is only 1 life per game. Otherwise, the uncovered cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile, and all adjacent non-mined cells will automatically be uncovered. Right-clicking (long-pressing on Mobile) on a cell will flag it, causing a flag to appear on it. Flagged cells are still considered covered, and a player can click on them to uncover them, although typically they must first be unflagged with an additional right-click. To win the game, player must flagging all the mined cells.",
